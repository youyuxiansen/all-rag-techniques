    "\n",
    "### Goal:\n",
    "Transform news articles about technology company acquisitions into a structured Knowledge Graph, using modern techniques for extraction, refinement, and reasoning — guided by foundational principles outlined in a conceptual book.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset: CNN/DailyMail\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach Overview:\n",
    "This notebook walks through a multi-phase process:\n",
    "1.  **Data Acquisition & Preparation:** Sourcing and cleaning raw news text.\n",
    "2.  **Information Extraction:** Identifying key entities (organizations, people, money, dates) and the relationships between them (e.g., 'acquire', 'invested_in').\n",
    "3.  **Knowledge Graph Construction:** Structuring the extracted information into RDF triples, forming the nodes and edges of our KG.\n",
    "4.  **KG Refinement (Conceptual):** Using embeddings to represent KG components and conceptually exploring link prediction.\n",
    "5.  **Persistence & Utilization:** Storing, querying (SPARQL), and visualizing the KG.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex NLP tasks like nuanced entity and relationship extraction, while also using traditional libraries like spaCy for initial exploration and `rdflib` for KG management."

    "### Initial Setup: Imports and Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theory:**\n",
    "Before any data processing or analysis can begin, we need to set up our environment. This involves:\n",
    "*   **Importing Libraries:** Bringing in the necessary Python packages. These include `datasets` for data loading, `openai` for interacting with LLMs, `spacy` for foundational NLP, `rdflib` for Knowledge Graph manipulation, `re` for text processing with regular expressions, `json` for handling LLM outputs, `matplotlib` and `pyvis` for visualization, and standard libraries like `os`, `collections`, and `tqdm`.\n",
    "*   **API Configuration:** Setting up credentials and endpoints for external services, specifically the Nebius LLM API. **Security Note:** In a production environment, API keys should never be hardcoded. Use environment variables or secure secret management systems.\n",
    "*   **Model Initialization:** Loading pre-trained models like spaCy's `en_core_web_sm` for basic NLP tasks and configuring the LLM client to use specific models deployed on Nebius for generation and embeddings.\n",
    "*   **Namespace Definitions:** For RDF-based Knowledge Graphs, namespaces (like `EX` for our custom terms, `SCHEMA` for schema.org) are crucial for creating unique and resolvable URIs for entities and properties. This aligns with the Linked Data principles."

    "**Theory:**\n",
    "To interact with the LLM for various tasks (entity type selection, NER, relation extraction), we define a reusable helper function `call_llm_for_response`. This function encapsulates the logic for:\n",
    "*   Taking a system prompt (instructions for the LLM) and a user prompt (the specific input/query).\n",
    "*   Making the API call to the configured LLM endpoint.\n",
    "*   Extracting the textual content from the LLM's response.\n",
    "*   Basic error handling if the LLM client is not initialized or if the API call fails.\n",
    "Using a helper function promotes code reusability and makes the main logic cleaner."

It's asked to select the *most relevant* entity labels from the spaCy-derived list, focusing on our domain, and to provide an explanation for each chosen type.\n",

    "3.  **LLM Call:** We use our `call_llm_for_response` function.\n",
    "The LLM's output should be a comma-separated string of chosen entity types with their descriptions (e.g., `ORG (Organizations involved in acquisitions, e.g., Google, Microsoft)`). This curated list forms a more targeted schema for our subsequent LLM-based NER."

    "## Conclusion and Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has demonstrated a comprehensive, albeit simplified, end-to-end pipeline for constructing a Knowledge Graph from unstructured news articles, with a focus on technology company acquisitions. We navigated through critical phases, referencing conceptual underpinnings from Big Data and Knowledge Graph literature:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Data Acquisition and Preparation:** We loaded articles from the CNN/DailyMail dataset and performed essential cleaning to prepare the text for analysis. This underscored the importance of data quality as a foundation (Ch. 1, Ch. 3).\n",
    "2.  **Information Extraction:** \n",
    "    *   Named Entity Recognition (NER) was performed first exploratively with spaCy, then more targetedly using an LLM guided by a refined entity schema. This created the *nodes* of our graph (Ch. 2).\n",
    "    *   Relationship Extraction (RE) using an LLM identified semantic connections between these entities, forming the *edges* (Ch. 2).\n",
    "3.  **Knowledge Graph Construction:** \n",
    "    *   Entities were normalized for consistency, and unique URIs were generated, aiding in entity resolution (Ch. 6, Ch. 8).\n",
    "    *   Extracted information was mapped to a schema (mixing custom `EX:` terms and `schema.org` terms) and materialized into RDF triples using `rdflib` (Ch. 2, Ch. 4).\n",
    "4.  **Knowledge Graph Refinement (Conceptual):** \n",
    "    *   We generated text embeddings for entity names, bridging symbolic and sub-symbolic representations (Ch. 6).\n",
    "    *   The concept of link prediction via semantic similarity was introduced, hinting at KG enrichment capabilities (Ch. 6).\n",
    "5.  **Persistence and Utilization:** \n",
    "    *   The KG was persisted by serializing it to a Turtle file (Ch. 3).\n",
    "    *   SPARQL queries were executed to retrieve structured insights, demonstrating the analytical power of KGs (Ch. 5).\n",
    "    *   A sample subgraph was visualized, highlighting the importance of making KGs accessible (Ch. 1, Ch. 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Future Enhancements:\n",
    "*   **Advanced Entity Disambiguation & Linking (EDL):** Implement robust EDL to link extracted entities to canonical entries in external KGs like Wikidata or DBpedia. This would greatly improve graph integration and consistency.\n",
    "*   **Richer Ontology/Schema:** Develop a more detailed custom ontology for technology acquisitions or align more comprehensively with existing financial or business ontologies (e.g., FIBO).\n",
    "*   **Sophisticated Relationship Extraction:** Explore more advanced RE techniques, including classifying a wider range of relation types, handling n-ary relations, and event extraction (modeling acquisitions as complex events with multiple participants and attributes).\n",
    "*   **Knowledge Graph Embedding Models:** Train dedicated KGE models (e.g., TransE, ComplEx, RotatE from Ch. 6) on the generated triples for more accurate link prediction and KG completion.\n",
    "*   **Reasoning and Inference:** Implement ontological reasoning (e.g., using RDFS/OWL reasoners) to infer new facts based on the schema and asserted triples.\n",
    "*   **Scalability and Performance:** For larger datasets, utilize distributed processing frameworks (like Apache Spark, conceptually linked to SANSA in Ch. 7 for ML on KGs) and deploy the KG in a scalable graph database or triple store.\n",
    "*   **LLM Fine-tuning:** Fine-tune smaller, open-source LLMs specifically on NER and RE tasks for the technology/financial domain to potentially achieve better performance and cost-efficiency than general-purpose models for these specific tasks.\n",
    "*   **Temporal Dynamics:** Incorporate the temporal aspect of news data more explicitly, tracking how information and relationships evolve over time.\n",
    "*   **User Interface:** Develop a user-friendly interface for exploring, querying, and visualizing the KG beyond programmatic access.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project serves as a foundational example, illustrating how modern NLP techniques, particularly LLMs, can be integrated with traditional KG methodologies to extract and structure valuable knowledge from vast amounts of unstructured text."
